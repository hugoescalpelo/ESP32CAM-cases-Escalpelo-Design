# ESP32CAM-cases-Escalpelo-Design
This repository contains the files and documentation about ESP32CAM cases by Escalpelo Design

This project is inspired by the lack of aesthetic cases for ESP32CAM in Thingiverse and Printables.

## Story

As part of my art and technology project, SÃ­ndrome de Estocolmo, I used a series of ES32CAMs as surveillance inside my apartment, which purpose is connect to AgentDVR to trigger a series of actions that are part of the project. Details in [estocolmosindrome.com](https://estocolmosindrome.com/).

## Roadmap
I want to design the following cases
- **Flat Case**. A case without support or mounting parts. This is meant to be stick with double sided tape *(done)*.
- **Tilt Case**. This case has a mechanism to adjust the tilt of the camera. It will have an 1/4" insert for mounting *(pending)*.
- **Vertical Case**. This is also a flat case and will be mounted with double sided tape in my door *(pending)*.
